# where.exe pip
# C:\Python39\Scripts\pip.exe

#
#  Run as admin ?
#
#  It seems to require
#     Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0
#   Get it with "Build Tools for Visual Studio at
#     https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

#
#   The following does not seem to work, either:
#     pip install beautifulsoup4  lxml

#  Can it be downloaded from
#    https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml
#
#    For example
#      lxml-4.5.2-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
     pip install C:\Users\Rene\Downloads\lxml-4.5.2-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl


pip install
