The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods:
  - one for embedding documents (which takes as input multiple texts),
  - one for embedding a query (which takes a single text)

The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding
providers have different embedding methods for
  - documents (to be searched over) vs
  - queries (the search query itself).


Methods:
  - embeddings     = embeddings_model.embed_documents([ â€¦ ])
  - embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query('how do i do that?')
