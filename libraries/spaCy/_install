# en_core_web_sm: the smallest English model spaCy offers and is a good
# starting point for NLP tasks.
# 
# en_core_web_sm is trained on OntoNotes 5 which is an annotated corpus
# comprising news, blogs, transcripts, etc. Put simply, this means a bunch of
# documents were labelled with information such as how each sentence should be
# parsed, whether a particular word is a noun or adjective or other
# part-of-speech, whether a word is a special entity like a person or a
# real-world organization, and other language-related labels. A statistical
# model was then generated from these labelled documents.
