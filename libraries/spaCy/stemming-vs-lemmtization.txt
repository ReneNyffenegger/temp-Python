The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and
sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.

However, the two words differ in their flavor. Stemming usually refers to a
crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of
achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal
of derivational affixes. Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly
with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally
aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary
form of a word, which is known as the lemma .
