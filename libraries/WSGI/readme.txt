When you want to create dynamic pages with Python on an Azure VM, a popular choice of web server is the Python built-in server (http.server). However, for production environments, it is recommended to use a more robust web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI, which are designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently. Here's how you can set up a basic web server with Gunicorn:

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   Install Gunicorn:

pip install gunicorn
Create a WSGI application file (e.g., app.py):

   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       return "Hello, World!"

Start Gunicorn using the following command:

    gunicorn app:app

Now, your web application is running on Gunicorn, and you can access it at
http://localhost:8000. For more advanced configurations and deployment on Azure
VM, you can refer to the official Gunicorn documentation
(https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/) and Azure VM guidance
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads-python).

Additionally, you may also consider using Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes
Service (AKS) for a more managed and scalable deployment of your Python
applications.
